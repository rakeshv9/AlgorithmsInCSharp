Sorting Algorithms for Coding Interviews

Why sorting is important?

Easy to search and retrieve data from datasets.
Its' very easy to analyze sorted data.

Differnt types of sorting algorithms 
---------------------------------
Simple sorting algorithms
  Bubble sort, 
  Insertion sort, 
  Selection sort 
---------------------------------
Efficient sorting algorithms
  Merge Sort, 
  Heap Sort, 
  Quick sort
---------------------------------
Non-comparision sorting algorithms
 Radix sort, 
 Count sort, 
 Bucket sort

Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sorts take 
	O(n2) time complexity.
Merge sort, Quick sort - take 
	O(n*logn) time complexity.
-------------------------------------------------

Stable vs Unstable sorting algorithms:

After the given list is sorted, if the relative order of similar elements in the given input list and sorted list do not change, then it's called Stable sorting algorithms. Otherwise, it;s called Unstable sorting algorithms
